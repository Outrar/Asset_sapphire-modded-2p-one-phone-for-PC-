#amber is a good dear stone and it 
very beautiful 
amber card edition for this game
firstly, these are no longer the same cells or slots as before
now (specifically only in the amber card version) it is now a card game
This is a very specific project. 
I will briefly outline the rules: there are 4 suits: spades, diamonds, clubs and hearts
but besides them there is a diamond card with an effect and an amber card
but in spite of this, cards of the same suit and the same number can be repeated (and not only in the hand)


BRILLIANT = '.|D◊|.'
ATACK = '. |↯| .'
DEFEND = '.|DEF▼|.'
AMBER = '.|A◊A|.'
abyss = '.i○◌i.'
full = '.| ↟◊▧ |.'
bomb = '. | 💥ϐ | .'
card = '. |▮◊| .'

def Amber_card_referens():
    print(ATACK,abyss,abyss,full,full,bomb,abyss,)
    print()
    print(abyss,full,abyss,bomb,full,abyss,abyss,)
    print()
    print(full,abyss,abyss,full,BRILLIANT,bomb,abyss,)
    print()
    print(abyss,full,abyss,bomb,full,abyss,abyss,)
    print()
    print(abyss,AMBER,abyss,full,full,bomb,DEFEND)
    print()
    print(full,abyss,abyss,full,full,bomb,abyss)
    print()
